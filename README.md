 Credit Card Fraud Detection

Project Overview

This project aims to build a classification model to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 0.172% of transactions being fraudulent. This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset contains the following key features:
- `Time`: Seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- `V1` to `V28`: Principal components obtained with PCA.
- `Amount`: Transaction amount.
- `Class`: Binary label, 1 for fraudulent transactions, 0 otherwise.

The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

Requirements

To run the project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `imbalanced-learn`
- `xgboost`

You can install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset file `creditcard.csv`.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks with EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.
- `output/`: Contains output files, such as model performance results.

Feature Engineering

The following features were engineered to improve model performance:
- User-related features: Purchase frequency, average transaction amount, etc.
- Product-related features: Product category popularity, average price, etc.

Modeling

The following models were tested:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. XGBoost

Hyperparameter Tuning

GridSearchCV was used to perform hyperparameter tuning on the Random Forest and XGBoost models, optimizing parameters such as:
- Random Forest: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`, `max_features`.
- XGBoost: `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`, `subsample`, `colsample_bytree`.

Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- AUC (Area Under the Curve)
- F1-Score

Results

The best results were obtained using the XGBoost model:
- Logistic Regression: AUC: 0.9469, F1-Score: 0.9454
- Random Forest: AUC: 0.9877, F1-Score: 0.9875
- XGBoost: AUC: 0.9998, F1-Score: 0.9998

How to Run

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Load the dataset and preprocess it (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
   - Balance the data using SMOTE.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Engineer relevant features to improve model performance.

3. Modeling:
   - Train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
   - Evaluate model performance using AUC and F1-Score.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for Random Forest and XGBoost.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the best models on the test set.

Future Work

- Implement additional models like SVM, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- Explore additional feature engineering techniques.
- Experiment with different balancing techniques.
- Develop a deployment pipeline for real-time fraud detection.
